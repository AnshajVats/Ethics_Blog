      "Hello, my name is Anshaj Vats, and I'm a computer science major in my junior year at the University of San Francisco. I've never attended SFSU before this semester. I am pleased with my summer internship with Amazon in 2023. It was a fantastic educational opportunity that strengthened my abilities and gave me a sense of independence. I was dependent on my parents for financial assistance before this internship, but after it, I gained financial independence. I also take great delight in my fellowship at Girl Makes Games, where I was able to instruct girls with impairments in game creation. also was rewarding to mentor them to produce their greatest games, and also brought attention to how crucial diversity is in the IT sector. These experiences have shaped my journey and fueled my passion for making a positive impact through technology.\n\n\n For years, many people have debated whether a hotdog is a sandwich. At first look, it appears to meet the fundamental definition of a sandwich: a filling wrapped between two slices of bread or a roll. However, on closer investigation, the categorization becomes less apparent. One argument against the hotdog as a sandwich arises from its common menu placement. Hotdogs are frequently listed separately from sandwiches in restaurants and fast-food establishments, similar to burgers. This implies that there is a perceived difference between the two. Hotdogs, like burgers, appear to inhabit a distinct realm. Not only that, but a hotdog without a bun is a completely different animal. A hotdog is just a sausage without the surrounding bread. This striking difference emphasizes the significance of the bun in determining a hotdog's character. Unlike sandwiches, which retain their essence regardless of the bread used, the lack of a bun diminishes the hotdog's sandwich-like properties. Hotdogs' adaptability also makes it more difficult to classify them as sandwiches. A common practice is to chop hotdogs and add them to different recipes, including macaroni or spaghetti. When this happens, they completely lose their ability to conjure up images of sandwiches. While the precise definition of a sandwich includes hotdogs, the context in which they are consumed and presented suggests different. Hotdogs are classified as a unique entity from sandwiches due to their distinct menu location. So, despite looks, there is still a compelling argument against hotdogs being categorized as sandwiches. Personally, I have only had hotdogs twice in my life because I don't eat red meat. Instead, I consume a lot of chicken and seafood. So, my opinion on hotdogs is more based on what I observe rather than my personal experience of consuming them frequently.",

      "As Malala Yousafzai said, \"Let us remember: One book, one pen, one child,and one teacher can change the world.\" The ethical conundrum of illegallydownloading textbooks becomes a significant matter for college studentstrying to get necessary learning materials, especially when the cost oftextbooks for courses like this one may rise as high as $117. Illegaltextbook downloading might be viewed from a utilitarian standpoint as apractical reaction to the unfairness caused by high textbook prices.Students benefit from illegal downloads since they provide them access toeducational resources that they otherwise wouldn't be able to buy.Similarly, from a deontological perspective, it is important to take intoaccount the larger social context in which intellectual property rightsviolations occur. Students defend the values of justice and fairness, whichare essential to deontological ethics, by opposing unfair systems andfighting for educational equality. To explain this idea let's take an example:Despite the fact that murdering is typically seen as wrong, there are situations in which taking drastic measures—such as shooting an intruder—to save your family is ethically acceptable since doing so is fundamentally right. Similarly, while downloading textbooks illegally may be considered wrong, its promotion of educational equality can lead to a viewpoint where it is deemed ethically correct under the lens of deontology. However, virtue ethics provides a more complex analysis of the morality of obtaining textbooks illegally. Students can claim that they are performing their responsibilities as learners by getting crucial resources. In this view, proper functioning is working to eliminate barriers that prevent one from achieving their educational goal. Students that engage in illegal downloading show that they are dedicated to learning and that they are prepared to overcome obstacles that stand in the way of their academic progress. Also, qualities like fairness and wisdom are as important as virtues like honesty and integrity. Students who engage in illegal downloads 3 show a commitment to justice by fighting for educational equality. Furthermore, by prioritizing their educational demands in difficult situations demonstrates their practical wisdom. In conclusion, while downloading textbooks illegally may at first seem morally wrong. A deeper look at the various ethical frameworks suggests that it may actually be justified as long as it is promoting educational equality. It is clear from taking into account utilitarian and deontological ethics viewpoints that students who participate in illegal downloads are supporting more fair and just educational practices. Students are putting the interests of the group ahead of their own. Additionally, from a virtue ethics perspective, by removing obstacles that stand in the way of their academic goals, students may be considered as carrying out Aristotle's description of their job as learners. \"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world,\" as Nelson Mandela once said and we can definitely do with some changes in this word. In a society where financial obstacles shouldn't limit access to education, it is morally necessary to guarantee equal learning opportunities for all students.",

      "In Chapter 1 of The Gift of Fire, Sara Baase discusses several changes and unexpected developments, one of which is the proliferation of surveillance technologies. This development has significant implications for society over the next ten years. From an ethical perspective, the utilitarian theory can be applied to analyze its impact and suggest courses of action. Surveillance technologies, such as facial recognition, GPS tracking, and online monitoring, have become increasingly prevalent in recent years. These technologies offer benefits such as improved security, more efficient law enforcement, and personalized services. However, they also raise serious ethical concerns regarding privacy, freedom, and social control. 1 From a utilitarian standpoint, the benefits of surveillance technologies must be weighed against their harms. While these technologies can enhance security and convenience for many people, they also have the potential to infringe on individuals' rights and freedoms. For example, widespread surveillance can lead to increased social control, eroding the autonomy of individuals and stifling dissent. Additionally, the collection and storage of massive amounts of personal data raise concerns about data security and misuse. To address these issues, society must take a balanced approach that maximizes the benefits of surveillance technologies while minimizing their harms. This could involve implementing strict regulations and oversight mechanisms to ensure that these technologies are used responsibly and ethically. For example, laws could be enacted to limit the use of facial recognition technology to specific purposes, such as law enforcement or airport security, and to prohibit its use for mass surveillance or tracking individuals without their consent. My Essay In first chapter,, one of the topics introduced by Sara Baase is surveillance technologies. According to Sara, technologies like facial recognition, GPS tracking, and online monitoring have raised significant privacy concerns. Sara suggests that there should be an appropriate response from both a societal and software developer perspective. 2 If we look at the implications of surveillance technologies through the lens of Utilitarian ethics, we will find that the harms significantly outweighs the benefits. Utilitarianism focuses on maximizing overall pleasure, minimizing pain, and finding the best outcome. Overall, it is a future-oriented approach. In the case of surveillance technologies, the benefits include improved security, more efficient law enforcement, and personalized services. However, these benefits are severely outweighed by the potential harm such as privacy violations, erosion of autonomy, and social control. The best examples of this are the revelations by Edward Snowden in 2013 about the US government's mass surveillance programs such as Prism. It highlights how surveillance technology can destroy individual privacy and civil liberties. Furthermore, the collection and storage of vast amounts of personal data raise concerns about data security, and unauthorized access to this data can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other forms of harm. In the next ten years, there will be more public awareness and concern about the extent of government surveillance. It will definitely spark legal challenges that will lead to reform in surveillance practices. If it doesn’t happen, then these surveillance technologies become more integrated in our everyday life like smartphones, and people will learn to survive under surveillance. To address these issues, society should prioritize minimizing the potential harm of surveillance technologies. This could involve implementing strict regulations and oversight mechanisms to ensure responsible and ethical use. For instance, laws could 3 limit the use of facial recognition technology to specific purposes, such as law enforcement or airport security, and prohibit the use for mass surveillance without individual consent. Additionally, not only people but software developers also have to address this issue. It is essential for a software developer to consider the technologies they are creating. A developer should at least ensure that people using their technology are aware of the ethical concerns regarding it. Developers could consider designing systems that have built-in privacy protection. In conclusion, the harm done by surveillance technology definitely outweighs the positive side of it. So according to utilitarianism, surveillance technology is unethical. We should not use facial recognition and GPS tracking, etc. It is evident that these technologies may be the downfall to personal security. If we can't stop it, then at least minimize the use of it. As a society, we must take proactive steps to regulate and control the use of these technologies. As the saying goes, \"With great power comes great responsibility,\" and it is our ethical duty to wield technological advancements responsibly. ",

      "In today's digital age, technology companies have unprecedented access to vast amounts of personal information. Despite concerns that these companies may know too much about us, it is important to consider the nuances of data ownership.. Firstly, the collection and use of personal information by technology companies are often governed by terms of service agreed upon by users. As discussed in The Gift of Fire, individuals enter into agreements with technology companies when they use their services, implying a degree of consent to the collection and use of their data. Technology companies play a crucial role in the digital economy by providing innovative products that rely on the collection of user data. This data can be used to improve services.  For example, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all free-to-use services that have become integral parts of our lives. These platforms continuously analyze popular features and update them. For instance, the \"story\" feature on Instagram was widely used. Later it was added to Facebook and WhatsApp. This integration has significantly improved users' life. Meta, the parent company of these platforms, has heavily invested in analyzing the data collected from users to enhance their experiences. This integration has significantly improved users' experiences and demonstrates the positive impact of data analysis by technology companies. However, concerns about data ownership and privacy remain. While users may have a right to control their data, technology companies invest significant resources in collecting, processing, and analyzing this data. The question of who owns personal data and how it should be used is a complex ethical issue. For instance, many argue that tech companies use personal data for purposes beyond what users may have agreed to, raising questions about data ownership and control. The broader implications of data ownership and privacy breaches must be considered. Personal data is not only used by technology companies but also by governments and other organizations for various purposes, including law enforcement and public health. Without proper regulations, there is a risk that personal information could be used for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or surveillance. The new technologies and changing government policies have impacted the ability of law enforcement agencies to intercept communications. The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires that the technology used in communications systems must be designed to ensure the ability of law enforcement agencies to intercept communications. This raises privacy concerns, as well as the potential for abuse by government agencies. In addition to this, The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986 extended wiretapping restrictions to electronic communications, including email and cell phones, marking a significant step toward protecting privacy. However, the USA PATRIOT Act passed after the 2001 terrorist attacks, weakened the ECPA and expanded government surveillance powers, raising concerns about privacy rights. In conclusion, while technology companies' access to personal information has led to numerous benefits, concerns about data ownership and privacy exist. Companies need to be transparent about their data practices, and for users to be aware of their rights regarding their personal information. As technology continues to advance, the debate over data ownership and privacy will likely remain a complex and evolving issue.",

      "In an era dominated by digital communication, the question of government access to private messages online has become increasingly relevant. While there are legitimate reasons for governments to access such information, such as national security concerns or criminal investigations, the potential for abuse and violation of privacy rights looms large. Therefore, it is crucial to establish clear conditions, oversight mechanisms, and safeguards to ensure that government access is limited, justified, and subject to rigorous scrutiny. Conditions for Government Access Government access to private messages should only be permitted under specific conditions, with strict oversight and safeguards in place. Firstly, access should be granted when there is a clear and present danger to public safety, such as in cases of imminent terrorist attacks. In such situations, the government may need access to private messages to identify and apprehend suspects quickly. Secondly, access should be granted when a warrant is issued by a court, specifying the crime being investigated and the scope of the search. This ensures that access is granted based on legal grounds and with a clear purpose. Thirdly, access should be granted when there is a compelling public need, such as in cases of major fraud schemes or serial crimes like rape. In these situations, access to private messages may be necessary to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators effectively. Justified Situations for Government Access One situation where government access to private messages is justified is in stopping a terrorist attack. The government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from harm, and access to private messages may be crucial in identifying and apprehending suspects before they can carry out an attack. Another justified situation is in building a case against a serial rapist. Rape is a serious crime, and the government has a responsibility to investigate and prosecute these cases. Access to private messages may be necessary to gather evidence and build a strong case against the perpetrator. Unjustified Situations for Government Access However, there are also situations where government access to private messages is not justified. One such situation is political surveillance. The government should not be allowed to use access to private messages to spy on its citizens or target political opponents, as this would be a violation of privacy rights and democratic principles. Another unjustified situation is investigating minor crimes. The government should not use access to private messages to investigate minor crimes, as this would be an overreach of government authority and could lead to abuse. Safeguards to Prevent Abuse To prevent abuse and ensure that government access to private messages is limited and justified, several safeguards should be implemented. Firstly, there should be strict oversight of any government access, by the courts and independent bodies, to ensure that it is granted only in appropriate circumstances. Secondly, the government should be transparent about its use of private messages, publishing regular reports on the number of requests for access, the reasons for the requests, and the outcomes of the investigations. Finally, encryption should be encouraged to protect private messages from unauthorized access. Weakening encryption standards could make private messages more vulnerable to hacking and surveillance, undermining the privacy and security of individuals. In conclusion, while there are legitimate reasons for governments to access private messages online, such access should be limited, justified, and subject to strict oversight and safeguards. By establishing clear conditions and mechanisms to prevent abuse, we can protect both national security and individual privacy rights in the digital age.",

      "In the realm of online communication, the issue of censorship, particularly concerning content involving nudity and sexuality, poses a complex challenge. While the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech, there are limitations, such as obscenity, child pornography, and threats of violence, that are not protected. Determining what content should be censored and who should make that decision is the biggest issue. One school of thought suggests that the government should play a role in regulating online speech. However, others argue that private companies have the right to set their standards. Some say Tech companies may be influenced by commercial interests or social pressures, while government regulation could potentially infringe upon freedom of expression. This has resulted in varying approaches among different platforms, with some allowing explicit content and others enforcing strict moderation policies. The Supreme Court's rulings on the protection of speech involving nudity or sexuality have far-reaching implications. While this protection is crucial for civil rights groups there are instances where legal statutes, like Texas' SB 8, complicate matters. Such laws allow for lawsuits against individuals sharing information on abortion access, illustrating that even the government faces challenges in determining what should be censored. This complexity extends to legislative actions like Sesta/Fosta, which aimed to combat online sex trafficking but, in reality, resulted in the worst kind of consequences. The legislation led to increased violence, arrests, self-harm, and suicide among sex workers, demonstrating the dangers of poorly conceived censorship laws. Furthermore, the fear of lawsuits has prompted web companies to aggressively de-platform sex workers and LGBTQ+ communities, showcasing how legal changes can impact the lives of millions. Therefore, in determining how to regulate online content involving nudity or sexuality, tech companies need to strike a balance between freedom of expression and protection against harm. While nudity and sexuality are natural aspects of human life, their portrayal in certain contexts can be harmful or offensive to others. For example, the distribution of revenge porn, which is the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, can have devastating consequences for victims. Similarly, hate speech targeting individuals based on their characteristics can create a hostile environment. Navigating the complexities of online censorship requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach. One potential solution is for social media companies to adopt clear and consistent guidelines for acceptable content, with specific provisions for nudity and sexuality. These guidelines should be developed in consultation with experts in law, psychology, and ethics and should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changing social norms. For example, the discrepancy in censorship between male and female nipples exemplifies the complexities of regulating online content involving nudity and sexuality. This double standard highlights the subjective nature of censorship and the need for clear and consistent guidelines. The #freethenipple campaign underscored the importance of challenging social norms. Now equal treatment of all individuals regardless of gender is a natural law. By addressing such inconsistencies and adopting more inclusive policies, tech companies can move towards a better online future. In conclusion, tech companies should have the right to decide what to censor, as the government clearly can’t come up with one guideline for it. However, these tech companies should have clear and concise guidelines. Unlike right now, where every platform has its censorship policies. As the famous quote by John Stuart Mill goes, \"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\" Tech companies should censor content that poses immediate harm to individuals while allowing people to freely express themselves.",

      "The Copyright Dilemma: Tattoos in Video Games Copyright law is a complex law that aims to protect the rights of creators while balancing the public interest in accessing and using creative works. One recent case that highlights the complexities of copyright law is the lawsuit involving tattoos on LeBron James in the video game NBA 2K. Copyright and its Purpose? Copyright is the right that creators have over their original works. Its main purpose is to promote creativity by granting creators exclusive rights to use and distribute their works, thereby allowing them to benefit financially from their creations. Fair Use? Fair use is a doctrine in copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. It is intended to balance the rights of creators with the public interest in accessing and using creative works. Fair use allows for the use of copyrighted material for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Transformative Use! Transformative use is a relatively new addition to fair use law, established in the Supreme Court case Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music (1994). A new work based on an old one is transformative if it adds something new and has a different purpose or character that alters the original work with a new expression, meaning, or message. In considering the case of tattoos on LeBron James in NBA 2K, I agree with the court's ruling that the use of the tattoos was de minimis and did not constitute a copyright infringement. The court's finding that the video game maker had an implied license to use the tattoos through its agreements with the NBA is completely fair. In the pixel world, one of the major ways to differentiate characters from each other is through tattoos. Since LeBron gave the right to use his likeness in the game, it falls under fair play.",

      "Richard Stallman argues that all software should be free and open-source, meaning that users should have the unrestricted ability to use, modify, and distribute software without paying a fee or obtaining permission. He maintains that the current system of software ownership, in which developers hold exclusive rights over their creations, is detrimental to society and stifles innovation. Stallman asserts that software ownership obstructs the use of programs by restricting their distribution and modification. This limits the number of people who can benefit from the software and prevents users from adapting it to their specific needs. Additionally, Stallman argues that software ownership hampers the development of new software by preventing developers from building upon existing code and discouraging collaboration. One counterargument to Stallman's position is that software ownership is necessary to incentivize developers to create and maintain high-quality software. Without the potential for financial gain, developers may be less motivated to invest time and effort into developing new programs. Furthermore, software ownership can protect developers from unauthorized use of their creations and ensure that they receive fair compensation for their work. Another counterargument is that Stallman's vision of a society where all software is free could lead to a decline in the quality of software. Without the incentive of financial reward, developers may be less likely to invest in creating feature-rich and user-friendly software. Additionally, the absence of software ownership could make it more difficult to hold developers accountable for software defects or security vulnerabilities. While I appreciate Stallman's idealistic vision of a society where software is freely available to all, I believe that the current system of software ownership has certain merits. Software ownership provides incentives for developers to create and maintain high-quality software, and it protects developers from unauthorized use of their creations. However, I do agree with Stallman that the current system of software ownership can be restrictive and can hinder innovation. To address these concerns, I believe that we need to find a balance between protecting the rights of developers and ensuring that software is accessible and affordable to all. One possible solution is to adopt a tiered system for software ownership. Under this system, some software would be free and open-source, while other software would be proprietary. Free and open-source software would be available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute without paying a fee. Proprietary software would be owned by developers and would require users to pay a fee to use it. This tiered system would provide incentives for developers to create both free and proprietary software. Developers who create free and open-source software would be motivated by the satisfaction of knowing that their software is helping others and by the potential for building a community of users who contribute to the software's development. Developers who create proprietary software would be motivated by the potential for financial gain. The question of whether all software should be free is a complex one with no easy answer. Stallman's argument for free software is compelling, but there are also valid arguments in favor of software ownership. I believe that the best solution is to find a balance between the two, where software is accessible and affordable to all while still providing incentives for developers to create high-quality software.",

      'Hacktivism, the use of hacking techniques for political or social activism, raises ethical and social questions that vary depending on the political system in which it occurs. Not to be confused with activism. Activism typically involves nonviolent actions such as protests, petitions, or advocacy campaigns to raise awareness and bring about change. Activists work within legal and ethical boundaries to advance their cause, often leveraging democratic processes and institutions to achieve their goals. In contrast, hacktivism involves the use of hacking techniques, such as unauthorized access to computer systems or networks, to promote a political agenda. Hacktivists may engage in activities such as defacing websites, leaking sensitive information, or disrupting online services to draw attention to issues or to undermine perceived injustices. The quote from "Gift of Fire" raises important considerations regarding hacktivism and the political context in which it occurs. It suggests that the ethical and social justification for hacking to promote a political cause differs based on the level of freedom of expression in a given country. In free countries where individuals can freely share their opinions online through platforms like social media, the use of hacking to advance a political agenda may be seen as less justifiable. One point made by the book that supports this statement is the potential consequences of hacking. Hacking can have serious legal repercussions and damage the reputation of the hacker. In free countries, individuals have access to other means of expressing their political views, such as social media, protests, or contacting elected officials. These avenues are often less risky and more socially acceptable than hacking. Another point from the book that aligns with this statement is the impact of hacking on trust in the internet. Hacking can undermine the security of websites and data, leading people to question the safety of their online interactions. This lack of trust can have negative implications for the economy and society as a whole, as people may be less inclined to use the Internet for transactions or communication. I agree with the statement that in free countries, it is hard to justify hacking someone else\'s site to promote a political cause. The availability of alternative means of political expression, coupled with the potential consequences of hacking, makes it a risky and ethically questionable tactic. However,  there are circumstances in which hacktivism can be seen as a legitimate form of protest, particularly in countries where freedom of speech is suppressed. For example, hacktivist groups like Anonymous have used hacking to expose government corruption and human rights abuses in countries where traditional forms of activism are ineffective or dangerous. In these cases, hacking can be viewed as a necessary tool for fighting injustice and promoting freedom of expression. Ultimately, the justification for hacktivism depends on the specific circumstances and the political environment in which it occurs. While there are valid arguments against hacking in free countries, where other forms of activism are available, the situation is different in countries where freedom of speech is restricted. In these cases, hacktivism may be seen as a justified means of challenging oppressive regimes and advocating for fundamental rights. In conclusion, the quote from "Gift of Fire" highlights the complex ethical and social considerations surrounding hacktivism. While it may be difficult to justify hacking in free countries, where alternative means of political expression exist, it can serve as a powerful tool for promoting justice and freedom in countries where freedom of speech is suppressed. Understanding the nuances of hacktivism is essential for engaging in informed discussions about its role in society.',

      "Technological advancements have long been hailed as drivers of economic growth and prosperity. While this is often the case, it is important to recognize that not all technological advances lead to positive economic outcomes. In fact, there are instances where technological advancements can have negative consequences for the economy. One of the primary concerns surrounding technological advancements is the potential for job displacement. As technology advances, certain jobs may become automated or obsolete, leading to job losses in those fields. This can have a significant impact on workers who are not able to easily transition to new occupations requiring different skill sets. For example, the automation of manufacturing processes has led to job losses in the manufacturing sector in many countries, including the United States and China. Another potential negative consequence of technological advancements is increased inequality. Technological advancements can lead to increased inequality between those who have access to the latest technologies and those who do not. This can result in a widening gap between the rich and the poor. For example, the rise of digital technologies has created opportunities for those with the skills to leverage these technologies, while leaving behind those who do not have access to or the ability to use them. Another significant impact of technological advancements on the economy is the reduction in available work for men with a high school degree or less. According to recent statistics, fewer than 70 percent of men with a high school degree or less are currently employed. This decline in employment can be attributed in part to technological advancements that have led to the automation of many jobs that were traditionally held by individuals with lower levels of education. Additionally, technological advancements can have negative environmental impacts. The production and use of new technologies can lead to pollution and resource depletion, which can have long-term economic costs, such as the need for environmental cleanup and remediation. For example, the production of electronics requires the extraction of rare earth metals, which can have significant environmental impacts. One specific example of the potential negative economic impact of technological advancements is Uber's business model. While Uber has led to lower prices for consumers, it has also led to lower wages and fewer benefits for drivers. This is because Uber classifies its drivers as independent contractors, rather than employees. This allows Uber to avoid paying for benefits such as health insurance and unemployment insurance. As a result, many Uber drivers struggle to make ends meet and are vulnerable to economic instability. Not only that,  In New York City, the Haas Act limited the number of taxi medallions issued to operate a taxi, resulting in a scarcity of taxis and high prices for riders. However, the emergence of Uber disrupted this market by providing a more convenient and affordable alternative. This disruption led to a flood of drivers and a decrease in the value of taxi medallions. This example illustrates the potential of new technologies to disrupt existing markets and challenge established regulations, highlighting the need for policymakers to adapt to these changes and ensure that regulations are updated to protect both consumers and workers in the evolving economy. In conclusion, while technological advancements have the potential to bring about economic benefits, they can also have negative consequences. It is important for policymakers to carefully consider the economic impact of new technologies before implementing them and to develop policies that mitigate potential negative consequences. By doing so, we can ensure that technological advancements contribute to economic growth and prosperity for all members of society.",

      "This game was so addicting that I played it twice. I got 210 points once, and I was surprised because I thought I was doing well. The game ended, perhaps because of my choice to allow edgy content on the platform. There was a question about a team name being a slur, and I chose to add it to the algorithm. This choice ended my gameplay because people used the slur to harass others. In my second playthrough, my company, Ethnos, was focused on connecting humanity and being family-friendly. Now I understand why most platforms say they are family-friendly. The decision that shocked me was during the congressional hearing. For one of the questions, I distinctly remembered telling the truth, but the game or Congress told me it was a lie. I was so disappointed.

      "One of the main examples of a technology failure is the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine. The Therac-25, used in radiation therapy in the 1980s, was designed to deliver controlled doses of radiation to cancer patients. However, a series of design and software errors led to several incidents where patients received massive overdoses of radiation, resulting in serious injuries and deaths. What went wrong: Software bugs: The Therac-25 used a computerized control system to regulate the radiation dose. However, a software bug in the machine's control software allowed it to deliver doses hundreds of times higher than intended. : The hardware provided no way for the software to verify that sensors were working correctly. The table-position system was the first implicated in Therac-25's failures; the manufacturer revised it with redundant switches to cross-check their operation. Poor error messages:  Several error messages merely displayed the word \"MALFUNCTION\" followed by a number from 1 to 64. The user manual did not explain or even address the error codes, nor give any indication that these errors could pose a threat to patient safety. Lack of hardware interlocks: The design did not have any hardware interlocks Links to an external site. to prevent the electron-beam from operating in its high-energy mode without the target in place. What could have been done to avoid the failure: Thorough testing: More extensive testing of the software and hardware could have helped identify and fix the bugs and design flaws before the machine was put into use. Better user interface: The machine could have had a more user-friendly interface with clearer error messages to help operators understand and respond to malfunctions appropriately. Redundant safety systems: The Therac-25 could have been equipped with redundant safety systems, such as hardware interlocks, to prevent  failures in case of software or hardware malfunctions. Improved training: Operators could have been better trained to recognize and respond to potential malfunctions, reducing the likelihood of serious incidents. The design flaws in the Therac-25 were severe and had devastating consequences. The software bugs and poor error messages created a problem that led to patients receiving massive doses of radiation. The software bugs allowed the machine to deliver doses hundreds of times higher than intended, while the lack of hardware interlocks meant there was no way to stop the machine when it malfunctioned. Plus, the cryptic error messages made it difficult for operators to understand and respond to malfunctions. Overall, the design of the Therac-25 was deeply flawed, with errors in both its software and hardware. These flaws resulted in serious injuries and deaths, highlighting the importance of testing in medical devices. It also highlighted how important it is to have a good error message. The Therac-25 serves as a reminder to us, on how inadequate design and testing can have serious consequences.",

      "Working in the field of AI, particularly at a renowned company like Google, raises ethical considerations that align with the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. The ACM emphasizes the importance of contributions to the public and human interests (1.1), which is inherent in the technological advancements AI can offer for societal benefit. One must acknowledge the potential negative consequences associated with AI, such as job displacement and privacy concerns, and work diligently to minimize these side effects. Loss avoidance (1.2) is a fundamental principle to consider, urging caution against unintended consequences and intentional abuse of AI systems. Integrity and trust (1.3) are crucial; clear communication about AI's capabilities and limitations is essential to build trust among stakeholders. Fairness and non-discrimination (1.4) are pivotal in AI development to ensure inclusivity and prevent biases. It is imperative that AI programs are fair and equitable, avoiding discrimination based on factors like age, gender, race, or religion. Additionally, respecting privacy (1.6) is paramount, requiring responsible use of personal data and implementation of strong data protection measures. Some may question the ethics of working at Google due to its influence and past ethical issues. However, it is ethical to work at Google as long as AI development adheres to ACM principles. Fear of change should not drive ethical decisions, especially when considering life-changing opportunities. It is essential to recognize that every company has faced ethical challenges, and AI, like any technology, can be dangerous if not developed and used responsibly. Every company, including Google, has faced ethical challenges at some point. One notable example is the case of Volkswagen, which faced significant backlash after it was discovered that they had intentionally programmed their diesel engines to activate certain emissions controls only during laboratory emissions testing. This allowed the vehicles to pass emissions tests while emitting up to 40 times more pollution in real-world driving conditions. This scandal, known as \"Dieselgate,\" resulted in fines, legal action, and a damaged reputation for Volkswagen. However, it is ethical to work at Google as long as AI development aligns with ACM principles and strives to make a positive impact on society. It's important for individuals working in AI, particularly at large companies like Google, to be aware of past ethical lapses in the industry and strive to uphold the highest ethical standards in their work. In conclusion, working on AI at Google can be an ethical choice if it aligns with ACM principles. By ensuring contributions to public welfare, avoiding harm, maintaining integrity, promoting fairness, and respecting privacy, AI developers can make a positive impact on society.",

      "One of the most valuable aspects of this course has been its focus on developing the skill of reading articles and current affairs news effectively. This skill not only kept me abreast of the latest news in my field but also enhanced my ability to critically analyze it. For instance, in a recent discussion, we delved into the review bombing of Helldrivers 2, a topic that challenged our preconceived notions. By examining similar instances of review bombing in films like Ghostbusters and Miss Marvel, we gained a deeper understanding of how this practice is often employed negatively. This course also provided a platform for engaging discussions and thought experiments, which I found particularly enriching. These discussions not only broadened my perspective but also helped me connect with my peers and engage in ethical dialogues. For example, one memorable discussion revolved around the importance of gender representation in media. When the lead actress in Miss Marvel emphasized the need for more female reporters in journalism, it sparked a meaningful conversation about diversity and representation. However, one aspect of the course that proved challenging for me was the weekly writing requirement. As a computer science major, I found it difficult to consistently produce 500-700 words per week. This challenge sometimes led me to include filler words in my essays to meet the word count. To address this, I believe reducing the word count to 300-400 words in future iterations of the course would enhance the focus and clarity of our writing assignments. I believe the professor had well-structured lecture plans. I knew what to expect coming into the class: we would first hear about the latest news, which would then lead to the week's topic, and then we would switch to the essay topic.",

    answer:
      "Kant's categorical imperative is a deontological ethical theory that emphasizes universal rules and duties. According to Kant, an action is morally right if it can be universalized, meaning that everyone could act in the same way in a similar situation without leading to logical contradictions. For example, lying would be considered morally wrong according to Kant because if everyone lied all the time, trust and communication would break down. On the other hand, Aristotle's virtue ethics focuses on developing virtuous character traits, such as courage, honesty, and compassion, through habituation and practical wisdom. Aristotle believed that by cultivating these virtues, individuals could achieve eudaimonia, or flourishing, which is the ultimate goal of human life. Unlike Kant, who emphasizes following universal rules, Aristotle's virtue ethics is more concerned with the moral character of the individual and the cultivation of virtuous habits. Despite their differences, these two ethical theories can be seen as complementary. Kant's emphasis on universal rules can provide a framework for evaluating the moral worth of actions, while Aristotle's focus on character development can help individuals cultivate the virtues necessary to make morally right decisions in specific situations.",

      "Deontological ethics, often associated with philosopher Immanuel Kant, focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, regardless of the consequences. According to this view, certain actions are inherently moral or immoral, and individuals have a duty or obligation to follow certain rules. Teleological ethics, on the other hand, is a consequentialist approach that evaluates the morality of an action based on its outcomes or consequences. This perspective is often associated with utilitarianism, which holds that the right action is the one that produces the greatest overall happiness or good for the greatest number of people.Regarding healthcare, the question of whether it is a negative or positive right depends on the ethical framework one adopts. From a deontological perspective, healthcare could be seen as a positive right, meaning that individuals have a right to receive healthcare services because it is their moral entitlement. This view is based on the idea that access to healthcare is necessary for individuals to lead healthy and fulfilling lives, and that society has a duty to provide this access. From a teleological perspective, healthcare could also be considered a positive right, as providing healthcare can lead to positive outcomes such as improved health, increased well-being, and greater overall happiness for individuals and society. By ensuring access to healthcare services, society can maximize the overall good for its members.",

In the context of fashion and design, this means that the design or concept should be sufficiently original or unique to warrant legal protection. If a design is considered too similar to existing designs or lacks significant creative innovation, it may not meet the threshold for novelty required for intellectual property protection.

Uber, a ride-sharing company, uses surge pricing to increase fares during peak hours or when demand for rides is high. Surge pricing has been criticized by some as being unfair and unethical. Critics argue that surge pricing takes advantage of customers who are in need of a ride and have no other option but to pay the inflated fare. Additionally, critics argue that surge pricing can lead to discrimination, as it can make it more difficult for low-income riders to afford a ride during peak hours.Uber has defended its use of surge pricing, arguing that it is necessary to ensure that there are enough drivers on the road to meet demand.
